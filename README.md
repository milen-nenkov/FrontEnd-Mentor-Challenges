# FrontEnd-Mentor-Challenges

Welcome to my first foray into frontend development.  
The challenges will be pushed into separate folders in the main repository instead of creating a new repo for each of them.

## What I have learned so far

* ### HTML
  
  So far did not run into any major issues with the HTML code. When doing these challenges, the most time spent on HTML is coming up with a proper structure to cover all css classes I would need according to my design solutions.  
  After the first couple challenges, I would actually spend some time looking at the provided jpegs and then come up with a structure as opposed to jumping in straight away. I found out this way to be more helpful down the line instead of refactoring divs and sections after an hour of struggling to get close to the required design.

* ### CSS  
  
  I do not have much experience except for the guided courses I have done online. I had to look up quite a few of the basic components and play around with layouts.  
  So far I am having a blast and try to come up with different ways to solve similar problems so I can experience something new with every challenge.  
  The main challenge so far has been responsiveness. I don't know if it is better to use pixels for the simple Newbie Layout challenges just so they are very close to the designs. If using ```vw```, ```vh``` or percentages the design looks almost the same on the specified resolutions but very different when moving between 375px and 1440px.

* ### JavaScript

  So far I haven't done any of the challenges requiring manipulation of the DOM so will update this section as soon as I get there.
