## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had to look up how to blend an image with background color. There were a few examples I could see but ultimately ended up using ```background-blend-mode: multiply;```.

Also spend too much time playing around with the mobile design. Maybe should follow mobile-first approach for next project and scale up to desktop size from there.

### Continued development

Will use mobile first approach approach for the next layout challenge. Also will time myself to get an idea of how long it takes me.
