## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Had to change the HTML code structure a few times to fix the issues with the design I was having. Next time I will spend a little longer on thinking about structure and classes before I start coding to ensure less backtracking.

### Continued development

Will use the learnings from this and past challenges and try to think about code structure before I start the actual coding.
