## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge I followed the mobile first approach. It was easier to scale up to desktop size than the other way around.

This challenge still took too long but starting to get the hang of layouts. With A LOT more practice I will get there ðŸ˜Š.

### Continued development

I will use a project timer for the next challenge. Not sure how long a simple layout like this should take so will ask in Slack for clarification.

Still need more experience with layouts but starting to get the hang of responsive design I think.
