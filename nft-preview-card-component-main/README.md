## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had to look up how to overlay different backgrounds on hover. Ended up using the ```background-blend-mode``` with different values between the 3 elements.  
Another option would have been to nest a couple div elements, have the bottom one hidden and then show it on hover.
