## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to lookup and experiment with grid layout and more specifically ```grid-row``` and ```grid-column``` shorthand for start and stop. I did find it hard to get the page close to the design but eventually got pretty close to the .jpg of the preview.
