## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had to look up quite a few of the ~~simple~~ concepts on MDN. This was the first project outside a guided tutorial I completed so still lacking in the knowledge department.

### Continued development

Will definitely need to focus on layouts again in future projects. I feel I have not even scratched the surface on flexbox and grid layouts.

### Useful resources

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) was indispensible in completing this project.
